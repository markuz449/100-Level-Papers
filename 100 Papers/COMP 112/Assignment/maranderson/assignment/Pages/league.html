			<h2>The South Island League</h2>
			
			<p>The year long South Island League is going well. In the last round Dunedin travelled to Invercargill. 
			A good win there for Dunedin against the hapless Invercargill with the sending off of Darren Carson for 
			talking back to the ref giving Invercargill a brief glimmer of hope almost immediately extinguished by two
			quick goals from Dunedin. Further north Christchurch were far too strong for Nelson and romped home 7 - 1.
			It was much more finely balanced for us against Timaru and I was seriously worried for a while.
			But then an inspired individual goal by Sam broke the spirit of Timaru and they never really 
			threatened for the rest of the game.</p>
