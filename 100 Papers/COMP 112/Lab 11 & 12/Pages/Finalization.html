		<h2>Evaluate again</h2>
		<p>The evaluation of the site as a whole should focus more on its behaviour as a unit than on the details of page layout, which you have already thoroughly considered when designing the template page.</p>

		<p><strong>Ensure that your site works as intended:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Test every link.</li>
			<li>Check that each page's position in the site structure is obvious to the user.</li>
			<li>Make sure all images display.</li>
			<li>Make sure all special characters display properly.</li>
			<li>Make sure alt values for all images are descriptive and sensible - view your site without images to test this performance.</li>
			<li>Test the site in different browsers.</li>
			<li>Read your entire site to ensure you haven't introduced any mistakes.</li>
			<li>Test all user input aspects of your site.</li>
		</ul>
 
		<p><strong>Remember:</strong> you created your site so you understand it, but you aren't the intended audience of your site. You must consider how a first-time user will cope with the experience you are providing in order for your site to be successful.</p>
